# This description is used to generate tags and improve search results.
#   * Think: What does it do? Why did you write it? What is the focus?
#   * Try to keep it short, snappy and to the point.
#   * Write the description between the DESC delimiters belo.
#   * Finally, don't worry about the indent, CocoaPods strips it!

  s.description      = <<-DESC
ActionCell, wraps UITableViewCell with actions elegantly, no need to inherit UITableViewCell, use swiping to trigger actions (known from the Mailbox App). I love it.
